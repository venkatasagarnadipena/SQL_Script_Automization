Merge Command Automation: Description and Usage Instructions
Overview
This script automates the generation of SQL MERGE INTO commands in a Delta Lake environment. Users can define merge configurations through direct code inputs, allowing for flexible updates, inserts, and deletions based on the state of the source table.

Code Breakdown
Block 1: Initialization
Initialize the following variables:
Source Table:
s_table - Name of the source table (e.g., "cba").
Target Table:
t_table - Name of the target table (e.g., "abc").
Column Definitions:
s_column - List of columns in the source table (e.g., ['emp', 'id']).
t_column - List of columns in the target table (e.g., ['emp', 'id']).
s_pk_list - Primary key list for the source table (e.g., ['id', 'emp']).
t_pk_list - Primary key list for the target table (e.g., ['id', 'emp']).
Block 2: Merge Command Without Deletion
Constructs a SQL MERGE INTO command that:
Updates records in the target table based on matching records in the source table.
Does not delete records from the target if they are missing from the source.
Block 3: Merge Command With Deletion
Constructs a SQL MERGE INTO command that:
Updates records in the target table based on matching records in the source table.
Inserts new records if they don't match.
Deletes records in the target table that are no longer present in the source.

Usage Instructions
Direct Code Input:

Define merge configurations directly in the script by setting the following variables:
s_table: Name of the source table.
t_table: Name of the target table.
s_column: List of columns in the source table.
t_column: List of columns in the target table.
s_pk_list: Primary key list for the source table.
t_pk_list: Primary key list for the target table.
Executing the Script:

After populating the variables, run the script to generate the appropriate MERGE INTO SQL commands. The script will output the generated SQL command based on the defined conditions.
